{"name":"Openglass","tagline":"Promoting an open community for google glass.","body":"### Promoting Glass as an open platform\r\nWe think the best way to promote and innovate on top of google's hardware is to have an open platform that enables users to extend it in new ways that google may not have envisioned. Google has made this \"easy-ish\" with other products that they control 100%, like the nexus line of products, including the nexus Q. We're encouraging them to make it easy to override their default Glass OS, and to not purposefully limit the device or extensions that can be built on top of it.  We're excited by this new type device and want the freedom to explore it's full potential.\r\n\r\n### Glass projects that are open source\r\nIn addition to an open platform, we're also encouraging those that have \"Glassware\" (Glass apps) that they built as part of the explorer hackathons (or after devices start shipping) to release their source code and promote an open community. Below are projects that have open sourced their code. If you'd like to add your project, please submit a pull request. \r\n\r\n## Faces and Names\r\nThis was our Glass NY hackathon project that allows you to take snapshots of people you meet, add names and contact information about them, and then review those contacts easily.\r\n","google":"UA-40157391-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
